# Workshop Data science

Let's have a look at various classification models in Machine Learning:

K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) |
Logistic Regression |
Random Forest |
Naive Bayes

# Methodology

Data Preprocesing, Train using Machine Learning Algorithms, testing, Adaptability Prediction, Result Analysis, Find the Best Model
